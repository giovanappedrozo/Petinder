Our idea from the beginning has always been to facilitate the adoption of animals, preventing the number of abandoned animals in Brazil, but it was only in the year 2021 that the project was finally developed by the team.<br><br>This is an adoption platform of dogs and cats that aims to bring together, in a quick and practical way, the animals that need a home, and people who are looking for a faithful companion on four legs.<br><br>Through PETINDER we aim to transform the world by generating impacts in the lives of animals, fighting against them, defending them and giving them an opportunity to be happy. We always fight for a better world, where all animals are treated with respect and dignity.";

When you decide to take a pet home, you end up bringing a lot of affection to his life, giving him a family, and yours, which will have the affection, company and eternal gratitude of a little friend on four legs. <br><br>In spite of that, did you know that the abandonment of animals in Brazil is not a small problem, nor a recent one? According to the World Health Organization, in 2014, about 30 million dogs and cats were already on the streets.<br><br>So, before adopting an animal, you need to make sure that you really are wants and/or is able to continue with the adoption, after all, being an animal's guardian is taking responsibility for a lifetime, and this will require time, dedication and patience, in addition to financial conditions. Do not irresponsibly adopt a pet and then abandon it.<br><br>Positively, in 2020, due to social isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in animal adoptions, due to loneliness that people met during that period. Despite this, the cases of abandonment are still much higher than those of adoption, so that there are still many homeless animals in the country. So why not start thinking about bringing a new friend into the house and giving them love and affection? Take a look at our animals and see which one melts your heart.";
